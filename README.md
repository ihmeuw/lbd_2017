This repo contains cleaned code used to generate the 'Mapping child growth failure in Africa between 2000 and 2015' and ‘Mapping local variation in educational attainment across Africa’ published in _Nature_ on 3/1/2018.

The repo contains three directories:
1) cgf - containing child growth failure specific code
2) edu - containing education specific code
3) mbg_central - containing model-based geostatistics code used in both projects
